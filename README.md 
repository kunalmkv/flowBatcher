Transferring tokens and native Ethereum (ETH) across multiple recipients can be a tedious and expensive process when done individually. With multiple gas fees for each transaction, it becomes inefficient and costly.

The Ethereum Batch Transfer SDK solves this problem by enabling batch transfers of ERC-20 tokens and native Ethereum (ETH) in one single transaction, thereby reducing transaction costs and gas fees. It provides a unified API to send multiple transactions to different addresses, making it easy to send tokens or ETH to multiple users at once.
Features
Batch Transfer of ERC-20 Tokens: Send ERC-20 tokens to multiple recipients with a single transaction.

Batch Transfer of Native ETH: Transfer ETH to multiple addresses in one transaction.

Gas Estimation: Estimate gas fees for batch transfers in both ETH and ERC-20 tokens.

User Confirmation: Prompt the user to confirm the transfer before executing, ensuring control over large transactions.
System Diagram & Flow
Batch Transfer SDK Flow
Hereâ€™s a flow diagram of how the SDK works:

User provides recipient addresses and amounts for either ERC-20 tokens or ETH.

Gas Estimation: The SDK estimates the gas fees for the batch transfer.

User Confirmation: The user is asked for confirmation to proceed with the transfer.

Token Approval (if needed): The ERC-20 tokens are approved before proceeding with the transfer.

Batch Transfer Execution: The SDK sends the batch transfer to all recipients in a single transaction.
